# What is the Blockchain Technology Club?

Founded in 2016, the Rochester Institute of Technology Blockchain Technology Club (aka, **BTCRIT**) exists to further the education and implementation of decentralized systems. We provide value to current, prospective, and past members with:

* A "crypto crash course" for a student-led, student-oriented overview about everything Blockchain, Web3, DeFi, etc aimed at those who want to learn more but don't quite know where to get started.&#x20;
  * Our next Crypto Crash Course is under development! We hope to host one in sometime in March or April of this year.&#x20;
* Club Meetings, with presentations on current events and demos/dives into various topics; often, these build on concepts from the aforementioned crash course.
* Opportunity to actively participate in the _implementation_ of concepts discussed at the club (eg. on-chain voting, club participation in hackathons, coding resources, etc)
* Connections to industry professionals, other clubs, and hiring pipelines aligned with RIT's "Thinkers, Makers, Doers" motto
* An open forum for discussing the latest news, aka our Discord server

### Formal Mission Statement

Our mission is to educate students about blockchain technology and explore its potential implications for society. Blockchain technology is rapidly bringing finance, supply chain logistics, voting, and more into the decentralized digital age. We aim to make it as easy to understand as possible, so that everyone can participate. Our members are developers, miners, traders, and just plain enthusiasts. Come join us!
